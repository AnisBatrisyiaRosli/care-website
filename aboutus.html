    <h3>CARE’s History: A Timeline</h3>
    <p>In 1945, as the world began to heal from the devastation of World War II, an inspired group of Americans sought to alleviate suffering. Seven decades on, their simple idea has evolved from a surplus package of U.S. Army rations to a global mission to uplift women and girls and ultimately eradicate poverty in every corner of the earth.</p>
